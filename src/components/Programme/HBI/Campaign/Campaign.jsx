            HBI has set an initial fundraising goal of â‚¦125,000,000
            (approximately $75,000 USD). These funds will be crucial for
            launching and sustaining our mental health initiatives. The funds
            will be used to:
          </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              Develop and implement new community-based mental health
              programmes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct public awareness campaigns to reduce stigma and promote
              help-seeking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide training and resources to community members and

            Every donation, regardless of its size, plays a vital role in
            achieving this goal and ensuring that individuals and communities in
            Nigeria have access to the mental health care they need.
